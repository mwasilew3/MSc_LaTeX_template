abstract = {In the course of the evolution of management support towards corporate wide Business Intelligence infrastructures, the integration of components for handling unstructured data comes into focus. In this paper, three types of approaches for tackling the respective challenges are distinguished. The approaches are mapped to a three layer BI framework and discussed regarding challenges and business potential. The application of the framework is exemplified for the domains of Competitive Intelligence and Customer Relationship Management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Human-centred design processes for interactive systems are defined in ISO 13407 and the associated ISO TR 18529. The publication of these standards represents a maturing of the discipline of user-centred design. The systems development community see that (at last) Human Factors has processes which can be managed and integrated with existing project processes. This internationally agreed set of human-centred design processes provides a definition of the capability that an organization must possess in order to implement user-centred design effectively. It can also be used to assess the extent to which a particular development project employs user-centred design. As such, it presents a challenge to the Human Factors community, and indeed a definition of good practice may even be regarded by some as an unwelcome constraint. This paper presents the background to the process-level definition of user-centred design and describes how it relates to current practice. The challenges, benefits and use of a defined human-centred design process are presented. The implications for Human Factors and other disciplines are discussed. In Appendices A–D, the process terminology and the contents of ISO 13407 and ISO TR 18529 are described in more detail, and three examples are given (in Appendix D) of using this process improvement approach to improve the actual design methods in three organizations.},

abstract = {Despite continuing debates about the "user" emphasis in HCI, new design approaches, such as interaction design, continue to focus on humans as technology users, constraining the human-centeredness of design outcomes. This paper argues that the difference between "user" focus and a human-centered focus lies in the way in which technology is designed. The emphasis on problem closure that is embedded in current approaches to designing information systems (IS) precludes an examination of those issues central to human-centered design. The paper reviews recent approaches to user-centered IS design and concludes that these methods are targeted at the closure of technology-centered problems, rather than the investigation of suitable changes to a system of humanactivity supported by technology. A dual-cycle model of human-centered design is presented, that balances systemic inquiry methods with human-centered implementation methods. The paper concludes with a suggestion that IS design should be viewed as a dialectic between organizational problem inquiry and the implementation of business process change and technical solutions.},

Consequently, there is a great variety in the ways it is applied, which may lead to poor quality and poor usability in the resulting systems, as well as misconceptions about the eﬀectiveness of UCSD. The purpose of this paper is to propose a deﬁnition of UCSD. We have identiﬁed 12 key principles for the adoption of a user-centred development process, principles that are based on existing theory, as well as research in and experiences from a large number of software development projects. The initial set of principles were applied and evaluated in a case study and modiﬁed accordingly. These principles can be used to commu- nicate the nature of UCSD, evaluate a development process or develop systems development processes that support a user- centred approach. We also suggest activity lists and some tools for applying UCSD.},

For this, a wide range of maturity models has been developed, but these models often focus on technical details and do not address the potential value proposition of BI. Based on an extensive literature review and an empirical study, we develop and evaluate a theoretical model of impact-oriented BI maturity. Building on established IS theories, the model integrates BI deployment, BI usage, individual impact, and organizational performance. This conceptualization helps to refocus the topic of BI maturity to business needs and can be used as a theoretical foundation for future research.},

Companies, interested to collaborate with M.Sc. students on strategic design projects, should have realistic ambitions with respect to innovation and value creation. Moreover, diversification is not the only generic growth strategy to gain competitive advantage. Value can also be created from developing new products for existing markets, or creating new markets for existing products. On the contrary, companies who aim for diversification in their generic growth strategies, may not always end up with a complementary “high valued” design outcome. From a learning perspective, the understanding of HCD methods created awareness among students and companies that respect and empathy for the end-user are important for enriching their design processes, as such increasing the chances for diversification in subsequent projects with clients.},

abstract = {The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Prahalad2000,
abstract = {The business world is shifting from formal, defined roles. Major business discontinuities such as deregulation, globalization, technological convergence, and the rapid evolution of the Internet have blurred the roles that companies play in their dealings with other businesses. The distinguishing feature of the new marketplace is that consumers become a new source of competence for the corporation. This competence can be seen in industries such as software, which have moved from testing products in usability laboratories, to testing them in customer environments. To effectively harness the competence of the consumer, managers must: engage their customers in an active, explicit, and ongoing dialogue; mobilize communities of customers; manage customer diversity; and cocreate personalized experiences with customers. The real challenge for senior managers will be to provide a stable center while embracing change. The only way to do this is to develop a strong set of organizational values. Readying the organization for customer competence in the new economy will require a major overhaul of the traditional governance systems and organizational structures of the company. The biggest challenge for companies will be to develop the infrastructures needed to support a multichannel distribution network.},
