\chapter{List of files created during the project}

Files created up to Development Phase:
\begin{itemize}
\item “MW v0.1 self” - file to learn Cognos, shows how to combine CRM data with Mosaic data
\item “MW v0.1 self2” - first attempt to create a chart, doesn't work
\item “MW v0.1 self3” - attempt to create a chart, the query itself is working (everything is correct from the sytax point of view), but data is unavailable (aggregate function? filtering error?)
\item “MW v0.1 self4” - debugging the self3 report, added a list to show filtered data returned from the query. Result: there are some entries after filtering, but not as expected
\item “MW v0.1 self5” - from the start, this time the results are as expected (type of result, number of result)
\item “MW v0.2, working chart, 3 days, type of report – day” - first chart working as expected, it shows numbers about queries from all services grouped into Mosaic groups, counted by reference, limited to 3 days (x - mosaic group, e.g. B, G, K; y - count by reference, multiple columns - different values in 'subject')
\item “MW v0.2, working chart, entire May (previous was 4 days), Mosaic group – subject” - second chart working as expected, more accurate; x - type code, e.g. A01, A02; y - count by reference; only 4 services - 4 columns; for the entire May
\item “MW v0.2, working chart, entire May, Mosaic group – subject” - similar to previous one, not as detailed, x - Mosaic groups, e.g. B, G; y - count by reference; columns - different services (different values in 'subject'); entire May
\end{itemize}

Files created during the Development phase:
\begin{itemize}
\item “MW one issue on multiple channels v1.0” - find cases of misuse of multiple channels
\item “MW report 3”, “MW Report 3, blank chart” - base report that can be used to generate different reports about number of interactions with the Council, couldn't overwrite the original one, created another one to have a more meaningful name
\item “MW report 3, chart 1” - both above and below 3 interactions on one chart
\item “MW report 3, chart 1.1 blank” - template for the charts 1.1 and 1.2
\item “MW report 3, chart 1.1” - chart with only above 3 interactions, using filter
\item “MW report 3, chart 1.1 correct” - chart with only above 3 iteractions, using filter and a list to show data (identical to the previous one, extended with the list, couldn't overwrite the previous one)
\item “MW report 3, chart 1.2 correct” - chart with only below 3 interactions, with list
\end{itemize}
 
further parts of report 3 have 2 dimensions with many entries. As a result it would have a lot of columns and would not be easily readable. I decided to split it into 3 charts: groups x services; detailed groups x services; selectable service -> group

\begin{itemize}
\item “MW report 3, chart 2.1” - Mosaic group x services
\item “MW report 3, chart 2.2” - Mosaic group detailed x services
\item “MW report 3, chart 2.3 group code” - the use of the selected service across different Mosaic groups
\item “MW report 3, chart 2.3 group type code” - the use of the selected service across different Mosaic detailed groups
\item “MW report 3, chart 3.1” - blank report that is used as a basis for the other 3.1 reports
\item “MW report 3, chart 3.1 above 3” - Mosaic groups that active users belong to
\item “MW report 3, chart 3.1 up to 3” - Mosaic groups that occassional users belong to
\item “report 3.1 “- 3 charts on one page
\end{itemize}

Another session:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item “MW Report 2, 2.1” – identify citizens who interacted multiple times
\item “MW Report 2, 2.2” – multiple interactions through different channels
\end{itemize}
